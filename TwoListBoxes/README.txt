===========================================
===== EB8 Two ListBoxes Version 1.1.9 =====
===========================================

This ActiveX Control will connect to a database and list all
the records on the first List Box (Left side). 

The users will be able to select items and move them to the 
second List Box (Right side). They can double-click or press 
Enter to move an item from one List Box to the other. They 
can, also, select various items from one List Box and move 
them to the other by using the buttons found below each 
List Box.

This ActiveX Control does a task that, at first glance, looks 
very simple. However, it took me almost a month to finish it. 
If you think that this control can be of any use for you, 
please, give me your vote and post some comments.
